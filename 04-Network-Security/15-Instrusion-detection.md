# Instrusion Detection and Prevention system

- ID and IPS have both signature and Heuristic matching system
- its just like firewall, network firewall
- to make sure everything capture network over client and server
- its network based
- its host based, client servers 

## ID
- they are passive, they monitor but they take no action other than sending out alerts.
## IPS
- similar to IDS but they also take action malicious traffic, what they do with traffice is determined by configuration

Note: They are packet sniffers with analysis engines

## Network base
- give full picture what happening ont he network
## Host base
-

## Note:
- its only react on given signatures
- since its unknow for everybody
-

## Heuristic base
- looks for abnormal behavious can produce a lot of fase positives

## Hybrid base
- they both look for signature and abnormaly


## True Positive:
- An attack is happening and the system detects it and acts
## True Negative:
- Normal traffice on the network and the system detects it and does nothing
## fale positive
- normal traffice and the system detects it and acts.
## false negative
- an ttack is happening the system does not detect it and does nothing
