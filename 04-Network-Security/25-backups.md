# Backups

## Fault Tolerance
- if the system is very critacl than we need high degree of redenchy
- if anythting fails we should have all that.
- we backup everything
- we have increasement backp
- we have difference backup since last changes
- we have full backup but doesn't have archieve
- retentation period depend on the business
- we need to keep the backup as small as possible
- we need to keep only those files which require
-

## Full backup
- its backup everything
## Increasemnt backup
- its backup everything but since the last backup
- we need all the taps to restore
## Differential backup
- its backu everything changed on last timem
- we can do full restore using only two taps
- day one full back and last one the day before
## copy backup
- its use when we uprade the system
- take full backup before upgrade
