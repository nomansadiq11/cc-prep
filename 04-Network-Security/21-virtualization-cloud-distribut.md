# Virtualization, Cloud, and distributed computing

## Virtualization
- poses a whole new set of standareds best pratics
- we distributed workload to multiple machines
- doing something we shouldnt
- not doing something
- virutal server very cheaper, easy to create, we can update the resouces
- let say an applciation require resouces than we can just assing to vm
- we can scale in or out base on the reqirements


## Hypervisor
- there are 3 types of the hypervisor
- type 1 we only need hypervisor on the harwared than we can create vm
- type 2 we can have on hareware os than hypersor
- we need also take care about hypersisor security
- resouces exhaustion :

## Cloud Computing
- every org is using
- cloud can help alot of way in org
- its depends how we can use it
## Private cloud
- build and run their own infra
## Public cloud
- some company build massive infra and they give to people to use it like aws, azure and google
- having these cloud much cheaper
- if we move to cloud secuirty could be risk,
- internet goes down
- anything is mission critical we keep to out infrra
## Hybrid CLoud
- a mix or private and public
## Communcaty cloud
- someone have same mission
- like healthcare cloud they can use only that one


## non-cloud
- we are the responsibel for everything like infra, storage network
## IaaS
- they are the response of the infra, network, storage
- anything top this we are the responsible
## PaaS
- we are responsbile of the applicaton
- vendor responsible for everything
## SaaS
- software as service like office 360
- dropbox
- many custom applications
- their softrware help dischar faster

## Distributed Systems
- DCE (we can use this all over the work, network, website, cell, networks, research, p2p networks)
- cdn is sub-distirubted system
- why we use: thye give us horizental scaling, we can add more services to our pool

## HPC (high performace computing )
- they desing for complex calculation
- its like clsuter
- compute, network and storage
- we need to have it
- if there is bottleneck anything it will be critical
- well know type super computers
- edge computer, like close as possible like cdn, not all edge computer is cdn
- Iot, self driver car, video conference
