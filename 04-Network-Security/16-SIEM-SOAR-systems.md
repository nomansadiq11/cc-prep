- all system logs, incident, everything send to cnetrol system
- both SIEM and SOAR have very nice dashboard
- has tremendous amount system access, we have to be take care aobut that as well.

- lets say if server memory going up for 90% send alert

## SOAR (Security orchestration, automation and response)
