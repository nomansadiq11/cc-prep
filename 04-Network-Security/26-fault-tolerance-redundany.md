# Fault Tolerance, Redundancy, and resiliency


## RAID
- two type of disks
- disk mirroring and disk stripping
- disk striping for writing to disk very fast, we need atlest three disks
- disk mirror: writing same data to multiple hard disks, this is slower, the raid controller has to write all the data twice

## System Redundancy
- we have redency power supply
- we have redundacny of the fan powers
- if one internet down 2nd one will take it
- we have to decide all future use not current use
- redundant system for crital is very benefits


## Database shadowing
- exact real time copy of the database or files to another location
## Electronic Vaulting
- Using remote backup service, backup are sent off site electronica at a certain internav or when files chagnes.
## Remote Journaling
- sends transaction logs files to a remote
