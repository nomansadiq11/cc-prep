# Cryptography
- this si testable
- symmetrics is much faster
- asymmetrics is slower

## Spartan Scytale
- Message written lengthwise on a long thin piece of parchment wrapped around a certain size round stick
## Caesar Cipher (Substitution)
- Done by switching letters by a certain number of spots in the alphabet

- We need to have confidinalty and availbity
- scryptology: is the science of security communcations
- Cryptography: create message where the meansing is hidden
- Cryptanalyssi: is the science of breaking encrypted commucations
- cipher: is a cryptography alogorithm


## Asymmetics encryption
- we use public key to encrypt it, but who has the private key can decrypt it
- its very good to sending the keys over the internet
-

## Attacks on our Cryptography
- steak the key: modern encryption being so differicl to break, it is easire to recover the private key
- brute force : uses the entire key space (every possbel key); with enough time, any plaintext can be decrypted
- MITA
