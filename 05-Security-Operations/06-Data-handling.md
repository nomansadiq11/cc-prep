# Data Handling, Data Storage and Data Retention

- how can handle the data
- this is who access the data,
- they are the poeople who can get the backup taps
- if someone is not part of the people list they will not get the taps
- we need to data store all the media all they ways
- as cyber secruity you need to know the law to apply the changes on the data


## Paper Disposal
- 6% lost and in proerply disposal
- data is data, its doesnt' matter its very important
- there is bin where store all the disposapla papers store, some company comes and take and distroy
- never ever send the sensitive data to trash

## Digital Disposal:
- deleting fa file just remove it from table everything is till recoverable
- formatting does the same but also put anew fiel streust over the old one still recovercable is most case
- overwriting clear is done by writing 0s or randome character over the data. but some cases there people retrive the data
- sanitization: is a process of rendering targe get on the media infeasible for a give level of recovery effort
- purge is removing sensitive data from system or device to a point where data recovery is no longer feasible even in a laboratory
- Deguaussing destroy magnetic media by exposing it to a very strong magnetic field. This will also most like destory

## Full physical destruction is ssafer than soft destruction
- disk crusher do exactly what their name implies they crush disk
- shredders do the thing as paper shredders do they just work on metal
- incineration pulverizing melting, and acid are also very rarely used to ensure full data destructiomn

- data handling is administra control, why, when and how ?
- we should have auditing and logs in place
- backup space kept in safe, climat control, doesnt take long time to restor
- how far we can store its our MTD
