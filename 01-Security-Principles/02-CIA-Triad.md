## Confidentiality 
- Kee the data securit 
- ensure no one can access the data 
- give them training and reaise them awareness 
- cracking password will take times like 50 to 100 years 
- giving password to somebody will not take much time. 
- Data at rest : data is not being used 
- data at motion : data transviering tinto a network 
- data in use: data actively being used 


## Integrity 
- Data integrity very important
- if data is transfered to other destination if is modify its not useful 
- data encryptiona also very important, if encryption keys also changed that cannot be decrtyp


## Availability 
- We want to pe0ple to the access the system 
- we they can't able to access the system its impact the business 
- We should path our system but before patching we shoudl test it shouldn't break anything. 
- we should have redenct in our system 
- we should have active and passive system 
- redency, redendency, and rededency 


Note: 95% cyber security about we shouldn't do this or we should do it
