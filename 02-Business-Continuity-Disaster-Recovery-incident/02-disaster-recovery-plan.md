- What is the objective and purpose?
- who will be the people or teams wh  will responsible in case any disruption heppen?
- what will these people do (our procedures ) when the disaster hits?

## summary

- its contineues improving the plan

## mitigation
- reduce the impact, and likeliness of a disaster.
## Preparation
- Build programs procedures and tools for our response
## response
## recovery


# BIA (Business Impact Analysis)
- identifies critiacal and non-critical organiztion system, functions and activities.
## RPO (Recovery Point of objective )
## MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)
### MTD > RTO + WRT
- The time to rebuild the system and configure it for reinsertion into production must be less than or equal to our MTD
#### RTO (recover time object)
#### WRT (work recovery time)
- how much time required to configure a recovered system
### MTBF (Mean time between failure)
- how long new or repaired system
### MTTR (Mean time to repair)
- how long will take to repair the system
### MOR (Minikum operations requirement )
- this much requirment of the electictity
- this much connecitity requrie


## Recovery Strategies
- From out MTF we can determine our approach, how to handle the disasters and sageguard.
- We put in place3 and mitigate and recover from them
